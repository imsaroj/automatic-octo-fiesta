## Headline: most Critical/High findings are resolved

| Original finding                                       | Status          | Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| #1 No CI pipeline (**Critical**)                       | ✅ **Resolved** | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: format-check → lint → typecheck → test-with-coverage → build, plus a separate Playwright E2E job with report artifact upload. ⚠️ but see "New issues" — the push trigger targets `master`.                                                   |
| #2 Single 2.6 MB bundle, no code splitting (**High**)  | ✅ **Resolved** | All routes `React.lazy` in `App.tsx`; `manualChunks` in `vite.config.ts` splits `react-vendor` (214 kB), `lexical` (386 kB), `ag-grid` (1.09 MB) into lazy chunks. Build now emits **117 chunks**; initial JS ≈ 430 kB vs 2.6 MB.                                        |
| #3 Zero component tests; grid tests deleted (**High**) | ✅ **Resolved** | **288 tests / 36 files** (was 52 / 7). Component render tests for smart components + form engine; `grid-datasource.test.ts` restores server-grid coverage; Playwright smoke E2E (5 specs: navigation, theme, form-engine, server-grid, action-buttons) wired into CI.    |
| #5 README boilerplate (**Medium→High**)                | ✅ **Resolved** | `a847b50` rewrote README (243 lines added) — narrative walkthrough of the library layers.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| #6 Theme toggle unreachable; `d` hotkey trap           | ✅ **Resolved** | `useTheme` now consumed in `nav-user.tsx` (visible toggle); the global `d` hotkey is **opt-in, off by default** (`theme-provider.tsx`).                                                                                                                                  |
| #7 `console.log(res)` in `users.ts`                    | ✅ **Resolved** | Gone; only an intentional demo `console.log("Submitted:")` remains in `all-fields-page.tsx`.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| #8 Duplicate `use-mobile`                              | ✅ **Resolved** | Single copy in `packages/ui/src/hooks/use-mobile.ts`; app copy deleted.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| #9 `FieldDefinition` non-discriminated bag             | ✅ **Resolved** | `form-engine/field-types.ts` now defines `FieldDefinition<T>` as a **discriminated union** (`TextField \| TelField \| SlugField \| …`).                                                                                                                                  |
| #11 `toolbar-plugin.tsx` 1,375 LOC                     | ✅ **Resolved** | Decomposed to **135 LOC** orchestrator + `plugins/toolbar/` section modules.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| #12 Suspect `@source` globs in `globals.css`           | ✅ **Resolved** | Depth fixed (`../../../../apps/**`); dead glob removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| #13 tsconfig `turbo` leftover; strictness drift        | ✅ **Resolved** | `packages/ui/tsconfig.json` cleaned; now also enforces `noUnusedLocals`/`noUnusedParameters`.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| #14 No coverage thresholds                             | ✅ **Resolved** | `vitest.config.ts` coverage thresholds (statements 21 / lines 22 / …) as a documented "don't regress" baseline (~24% lines measured); enforced via `test:coverage` in CI. shadcn primitives excluded by policy.                                                          |
| #4 Orphaned primitives + misplaced deps (**Medium**)   | 🟡 **Partial**  | `vitest` moved to devDependencies ✅; `resizable` removed ✅; but `chart.tsx`/`carousel.tsx`/`data-table.tsx` remain and `recharts`/`@tanstack/react-table`/`embla-carousel-react` were deliberately (re-)added as deps — retention is now a choice, still undocumented. |
| #10 `AllCommunityModule` registration                  | ❌ **Open**     | `grid-internals.tsx` still registers all of AG Grid Community — the 1.09 MB ag-grid chunk is the remaining bundle heavyweight (lazy-loaded now, so impact is deferred, not eliminated).                                                                                  |
| #15 No release/versioning (Changesets)                 | ❌ **Open**     | Still `0.0.x`, private, no changesets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| #16 Lexical HTML sanitization contract                 | ✅ **Resolved** | God Prompt 3: `lexical-text-editor/sanitize.ts` (`sanitizeEditorHtml` + `SafeEditorHtml`, DOMPurify allow-list matching the editor's node set, link hardening); inbound HTML sanitized on parse in `SmartTextEditor`; documented in `docs/security.md`. Tests in `sanitize.test.ts`.                                                                                          |
| #17 In-flight skill rename                             | ✅ **Resolved** | Working tree is clean.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Also done from the Top-20 list: **jsx-a11y** (`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` in both workspaces), **shared `GridToolbar`** (
`data-grid/grid-toolbar.tsx`), **`createPageFetcher`** (`data-grid/create-page-fetcher.ts` — exactly the wrapper the
audit proposed, with injectable transport and its own tests), **demo-data module** + **`SmartStatCard`** (the KPI-card
extraction the audit suggested).

## New since the audit (not in the original report)

The library grew four whole new domain engines plus supporting layers — source went from ~27.3k to **~39.5k lines** (~
304 files):

- **Search engine** (`@workspace/ui/search-engine`) — `SmartSearchForm`, a declarative filter bar composing
  `SmartForm` (manual/auto-search, query pruning, active-filter count).
- **Tree engine** (`@workspace/ui/tree-engine`) — `SmartTree`: lazy folders, tri-state checkboxes, keyboard nav, inline
  rename, drag-and-drop; pure `tree-utils.ts` with tests.
- **Transfer-list engine** (`@workspace/ui/transfer-list-engine`) — `SmartTransferList` dual-list shuttle; pure
  `transfer-utils.ts` with tests.
- **Calendar engine** (`@workspace/ui/calendar-engine`) — `SmartCalendar`: month/week/day/agenda views,
  drag-to-move/resize editing, an RRULE-subset recurrence model with series-edit helpers, and availability/slot-booking;
  date math unit-tested (3,651 LOC in one commit).
- **Action-button presets** (`@workspace/ui/smart-components/buttons`) — config-driven `ActionButton` + 27 named presets
  with optional permission gating, plus a showcase page and E2E spec.
- **TanStack Query adoption in `apps/web`** — `QueryClientProvider` + a reference CRUD example page (optimistic delete
  with rollback) against new MSW mutation handlers; the library itself stays fetch-agnostic.
- **`SmartPage` flat-props migration** — page layouts moved from compound/slot markup to a flat props API across 35
  files; `SmartDialog`/`SmartSheet` gained size presets and `dividers`.
- **Misc:** date-picker custom formats/dropdown-nav/time-zone support, Noto Serif variable font + typography defaults,
  sidebar flyouts for collapsed submenus, "loading more" indicator for infinite scroll, Spring query-encoder unit tests,
  Turbo upgraded to 2.10.4.

## New issues spotted today

> **Update 2026-07-08:** all four items below are resolved (God Prompt 1).

1. ✅ **CI push trigger targets a nonexistent branch.** ~~`ddbf927` switched `on.push.branches` to `[master]`~~ —
   fixed 2026-07-08: `ci.yml` now triggers on `[main]`; no `master` reference remains in the workflow.
2. ✅ **Orphan-primitive policy still undecided** — resolved 2026-07-08: CLAUDE.md's shadcn/ui section now has a
   "Vendored primitives policy" subsection (primitives are regenerable vendor code, kept with their deps for future
   adoption). Tree-shaking re-verified: production build (117 JS chunks) contains zero `recharts`/`embla` signatures.
3. ✅ **Test-suite hygiene:** resolved 2026-07-08. The "controlled/uncontrolled Select" warning came from **Base UI**
   (not React DOM) — controlled `SmartSelect` values flipping `undefined` → string. Fixed at the source:
   `SmartSelect.value` now accepts `string | null` (`null` = controlled-empty), `SmartSelectField` passes
   `data ?? null`, and the two demo pages pass their `string | null` state directly; the suite runs warning-free.
   Test wall time: `vitest.config.ts` split into `node`/`jsdom` **projects** — 13 pure-logic files (160 tests) now run
   under `node` (6 ms environment vs. seconds per jsdom file). Back-to-back A/B on the same machine: **88.9 s → 55.5 s
   wall** (−38 %), cumulative environment **605.6 s → 259.6 s** (−57 %), identical 288/288 pass count.
4. ✅ **Commit-message drift:** hook verified working 2026-07-08 — `git commit -m "WHAT"` on a scratch branch is
   rejected by the husky `commit-msg` hook (commitlint: subject/type-empty, exit 1), including on Windows. `03cab09`
   predates nothing broken; the convention is enforced going forward.

| **Overall Project**  | **7** | **8** | Every Critical/High item closed except AG Grid slimming; remaining debt is Medium or policy     |

## Remaining priorities (carried forward)

1. ~~**Fix the CI push branch (`master` → `main`)**~~ ✅ done 2026-07-08.
2. Register specific AG Grid modules instead of `AllCommunityModule` (the 1.09 MB chunk).
3. ~~Decide & document the orphan-primitive/dependency retention policy.~~ ✅ done 2026-07-08 (CLAUDE.md).
4. ~~Lexical HTML sanitization contract (DOMPurify helper or documented consumer requirement).~~ ✅ done 2026-07-08 (God Prompt 3).
5. Changesets/versioning when external consumption is planned; ADRs for the big decisions.

**God Prompt 3 (Security, 2026-07-08):** Security **6 → 9**. Lexical sanitize contract closed (#16). Added
CSV/XLSX formula-injection guard (`data-grid/formula-guard.ts`, wired into both export paths, tested with the classic
payloads). CI gained a `security` job (`pnpm audit --prod` high-fails / moderate-warns + gitleaks secret scan) and
`.github/dependabot.yml` (weekly grouped minor/patch PRs). Deployment security baseline written in `docs/security.md`
(CSP + headers with ready-to-copy Netlify `_headers` and `vercel.json`).

**God Prompt 4 (Accessibility, 2026-07-08):** Accessibility **7 → 9**. jsx-a11y recommended confirmed enabled in both
flat configs (lint green). Added an axe-core unit helper (`test-utils/a11y.ts` → `expectNoA11yViolations`) and a render
axe suite (`test-utils/components.a11y.test.tsx`) over 11 high-traffic surfaces (form, dialog, select, combobox,
date-picker, stepper, tree, transfer-list, calendar month+week, action buttons). Source fixes for the violations it
found: tree checkbox accessible name, combobox `role="combobox"` trigger name (new `aria-label` passthrough),
transfer-list rebuilt to a valid ARIA listbox (option on the `<li>`, visual-only checkbox, no nested interactive,
named listboxes) + keyboard (Enter/Space/roving tab). Added `@axe-core/playwright` E2E (`e2e/a11y.spec.ts`) scanning 5
routes in light+dark, failing on serious/critical — caught two real contrast bugs: light `--muted-foreground`
(4.34→~4.9:1) and calendar event chips mid-fade (fixed via a global `prefers-reduced-motion` rule + reduced-motion
scan). Skip-to-content link + `<main id>` landmark in `PlaygroundShell`. E2E green twice back-to-back.

**God Prompt 5 (Testing Depth, 2026-07-08):** Testing **7 → 9**. Unit tests 288 → **333** (40 files). Interaction
tests through the public API: `tree.behavior.test.tsx` (expand, multi-select, tri-state check cascade, filter mode,
imperative handle) and `transfer-list.behavior.test.tsx` (move all/selected both ways, `TransferChangeMeta`, disabled
items, controlled ids), plus the 11-surface axe render suite from GP4. Coverage lifted **~24% → ~60% lines** (stmts
58.6 / branches 53.87 / funcs 52.2 / lines 59.65); thresholds raised to 56/51/50/57 (well past the 45/45/40/25 target).
E2E 28 → **31**: `tree.spec` (keyboard expand + checkbox cascade + F2 rename), `crud.spec` (TanStack Query + MSW search
→ empty → restore), `calendar.spec` (view switching + date nav). Full E2E green **twice** back-to-back; trace
on-first-retry already on. Note: SmartDialog opened from external controlled state didn't open under Playwright's
synthetic click (create/edit/delete stay covered by the dialog component render tests); flagged as follow-up.

**God Prompt 6 (Documentation & ADRs, 2026-07-08):** Documentation **7 → 9**. Eight per-domain consumer guides in
`docs/` (form-engine, data-grid, search-engine, tree-engine, transfer-list-engine, calendar-engine, smart-components,
lexical-text-editor) following one skeleton (what / import / 80% example / props / escape hatches / gotchas / demo),
indexed by `docs/README.md` and linked from the root README. Five ADRs in `docs/adr/` (Base UI over Radix, source-only
package, hand-rolled xlsx, Spring `Page<T>`, flat-props wrappers w/ SmartPage-slots exception). `docs/component-map.md`
maps every engine/`Smart*` component → import → demo route → guide (with a "no demo" follow-up list). CI gate
`scripts/check-docs.mjs` (`pnpm docs:check`, wired into the verify job): every public `exports` subpath must have a
listed guide, and the doc snippets (`docs/snippets.test-d.ts`) must `tsc --noEmit` — a new undocumented entrypoint or a
broken snippet fails CI.

# Executive Summary

## What is this project?

`smart-component` is a **pnpm + Turborepo monorepo** housing a React 19 **enterprise UI component library** (
`packages/ui`, published internally as `@workspace/ui`) and a **Vite playground/demo application** (`apps/web`) that
exercises every component. The library is organized in four ascending layers:

1. **shadcn/ui primitives** (50 components, Base UI–backed, Tailwind v4) — `packages/ui/src/components/`
2. **Smart wrappers** (41 components + an 18-file slot-based `SmartPage` layout system) —
   `packages/ui/src/smart-components/`
3. **Domain engines** — a declarative **form engine** (TanStack Form + Zod, 26 files, 30+ field types), a **data-grid
   layer** (AG Grid Community: client-side `SmartGrid` + infinite-row-model `SmartServerGrid`), and a **Lexical
   rich-text editor** module
4. **Dependency-free utilities** — `cn()`, number/string formatters, and a hand-rolled OOXML `.xlsx` writer

## Purpose

To provide a reusable, opinionated component kit that collapses shadcn/ui compound-component boilerplate into flat,
prop-driven "Smart" APIs, and to solve hard enterprise UI problems once (server-driven grids with cross-page selection,
schema-driven forms, Excel export, full-viewport page layouts). An ESLint guardrail in the web app (
`apps/web/eslint.config.js`) actively enforces consuming the Smart layer instead of raw primitives.

## Current maturity

**Early / pre-release.** 28 commits, first commit ~2026-06-30 (days old). Versions are `0.0.0`/`0.0.1`, all packages
private, no publishing pipeline, no CI, no versioning strategy. Despite this, code quality and internal documentation
are far above what the age suggests.

| Demo routes in `apps/web`            | 24                                          |

| Runtime dependencies (`packages/ui`) | 37                                          |

## Overall architecture quality

**Strong (8/10).** Clear layering, disciplined module boundaries, pure logic extracted from components into testable
helpers (`pagination.ts`, `server-grid-internals.ts`), well-reasoned React patterns (refs-for-latest-props to keep AG
Grid datasources stable, id-set as source of truth for cross-page selection, slot detection via `Symbol.for` in
`SmartPage`). The main gaps are operational, not structural: no CI, no code splitting, no release machinery.

## Strengths

- **Exceptional inline documentation.** Nearly every exported symbol carries JSDoc explaining _why_, not just _what_ (
  e.g. the generic-`forwardRef` cast in `server-data-grid.tsx:601`, the self-update echo guard in `smart-form.tsx:283`).
  `CLAUDE.md` doubles as an accurate architecture doc.
- **Zero `any` in production code, zero TODO/FIXME markers.** Strict TS everywhere; `unknown` + narrowing used where
  dynamism is needed.
- **All quality gates pass:** typecheck, ESLint 10 flat config, 52/52 tests.
- **Modern, coherent stack:** React 19, Tailwind v4, Zod 4, TanStack Form, ESLint 10, pnpm 10 (with `allowBuilds`
  build-script allow-listing), Turborepo 2, Vite 8 (Rolldown).
- **Local quality gates:** husky pre-commit (lint-staged/prettier), commit-msg (commitlint conventional), pre-push (
  typecheck + tests).
- **Thoughtful hard-problem solutions:** cross-page grid selection surviving block purges (
  `use-server-grid-selection.ts`), Spring Data `Page<T>` contract with Zod validation (`pagination.ts`), dependency-free
  XLSX writer (`lib/xlsx.ts`) avoiding a heavyweight spreadsheet dependency.
- **Realistic dev API:** MSW mock server implementing a real paging/sort/filter query contract shared between client and
  mock (`apps/web/src/api/users-query.ts`).

## Weaknesses

- **No CI/CD whatsoever** — no `.github/`, gates are local-only and bypassable with `--no-verify`.
- **Single 2.6 MB JS bundle** (`dist/assets/index-*.js`), no `React.lazy`/`Suspense`/dynamic import anywhere; AG Grid (
  `AllCommunityModule`), Lexical, and all 24 pages load eagerly.
- **Dead weight:** orphaned primitives (`chart.tsx`→recharts, `data-table.tsx`→@tanstack/react-table, `carousel.tsx`
  →embla, `resizable.tsx`→react-resizable-panels, `menubar`, `navigation-menu`, `input-otp`, `hover-card`,
  `aspect-ratio`, `pagination` — zero importers), `@playwright/test` installed with no config or tests, `vitest`
  misplaced under `dependencies`.
- **README is template boilerplate** (stock shadcn monorepo text plus garbled `automatic-octo-fiesta` artifact); no
  consumer-facing docs for the form engine, grid layer, or page system.
- **Testing is thin relative to surface area:** pure logic is well tested, but zero render tests for the 59 smart
  components; earlier `SmartServerGrid` tests were deleted (commit `a2f5127`); no E2E.
- **Small hygiene issues:** leftover `console.log(res)` in `apps/web/src/api/users.ts:35`; duplicated `use-mobile` hook
  with two divergent implementations; theme switching reachable only via an undocumented global `d` hotkey; suspect
  `@source` relative globs in `globals.css`.

# React Review

- **Hooks:** Advanced and mostly correct. `useLayoutEffect` mirrors latest props into refs so the AG Grid datasource
  stays referentially stable ([server-data-grid.tsx:260](packages/ui/src/data-grid/server-data-grid.tsx));
  `useServerGridSelection` cleanly separates AG Grid event plumbing from selection state. The form engine's dual sync
  effects (mirror-out / reconcile-in with `selfUpdateRef` echo guard) solve a real max-update-depth loop and document
  it ([smart-form.tsx:309-344](packages/ui/src/form-engine/smart-form.tsx)). Two
  `eslint-disable-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` in `smart-form.tsx` are deliberate and explained — acceptable, but
  each is a contract future editors must know.
- **Context:** Used sparingly and correctly (`PageContext` for layout defaults, `ThemeProviderContext` with a throwing
  `useTheme` guard, sidebar context from shadcn). No context-as-global-store abuse.
- **Rendering & memoization:** `useMemo`/`useCallback` applied where identity matters (datasource, colDefs, handlers
  passed to AG Grid) rather than cargo-culted. `SmartForm` subscribes via `useSelector(form.store, …)` and
  `form.Subscribe` to limit re-renders. Reasonable.
- **Component composition:** Two complementary APIs — flattened props for the 80% case (`SmartDialog`
  `trigger/header/footer`) with documented escape hatches to primitives, and slot-based composition for pages. This
  matches the repo's own `vercel-composition-patterns` guidance.
- **Lazy loading / Suspense:** **Absent.** No `React.lazy`, no `<Suspense>`, no dynamic `import()` in app or library.
  This is the single biggest React-level gap given AG Grid + Lexical in the tree.
- **Performance:** Grid virtualizes rows natively; infinite model caps memory. Form engine re-renders the whole field
  grid on `values` change for `hidden()` evaluation — fine at current form sizes, worth watching past ~50 fields.
- **React 19 alignment:** `forwardRef` remains in `SmartServerGrid` and shadcn primitives even though React 19 supports
  `ref` as a prop (and the repo's own composition-patterns skill recommends dropping it). Low priority; the generic cast
  is correct.

---

# TypeScript Review

- **Strict mode:** On everywhere; web app additionally enforces unused-locals/params, `verbatimModuleSyntax`,
  `erasableSyntaxOnly`, `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`. `packages/ui` lacks those extras — worth aligning.
- **`any` usage:** **Zero** in production code (verified by grep). Casts are narrow, local, and always commented with
  the reason (`as never` bridging Zod↔TanStack Standard-Schema typing; the generic `forwardRef` re-assertion).
- **Generics:** Confidently used: `SmartForm<T extends Record<string, unknown>>`, `SmartServerGrid<TRow>` with generic
  imperative handle, `pageSchema<TItem extends z.ZodTypeAny>` returning a derived schema type.
- **Interfaces & utility types:** Public props are `interface`s with JSDoc on every member; `satisfies` used for AG Grid
  param objects; `keyof T & string` ties field names to the schema type.
- **Discriminated unions:** The notable gap. `FieldDefinition<T>` is one wide bag where `FieldType` doesn't narrow the
  valid extras (nothing stops `decimalScale` on a `checkbox`). A per-type discriminated union would move a class of
  misconfiguration to compile time. Similarly `value: unknown` flows through `FieldRenderer` with per-case casts — safe
  in practice, but a typed field-registry map could remove the casts.
- **Duplicated types:** `SPageResponse` deliberately mirrors `pageSchema`'s inferred type (documented); `use-mobile`
  duplicated across workspaces; `Theme` types local to the app. Minor.
- **tsconfig hygiene:** Root `tsconfig.json` is minimal and **not referenced** by workspaces (each is standalone) —
  fine, but a shared `@workspace/typescript-config` base would prevent drift. `packages/ui/tsconfig.json` includes a
  nonexistent `turbo` directory (leftover from `@turbo/gen` scaffolding).

---

# Component Review

**Duplicated components / logic**

- `use-mobile` exists twice with _different_ implementations (ui: `useState`+`useEffect`; web: subscription-style).
  Consolidate on the ui version and delete the app copy.
- `SmartGrid` and `SmartServerGrid` share near-identical toolbar JSX (title, column-visibility dropdown, export
  button) — extract a `GridToolbar` internal.
- Theme handling: the app ships a 230-line custom `ThemeProvider` while `next-themes` is a ui dependency (used by
  `sonner`'s toaster). One approach should win.

**Reusable opportunities**

- The KPI/stat card hand-rolled in `analytics-example-page.tsx` and `dashboard-example-page.tsx` is a natural
  `SmartStatCard`.
- The demo pages repeatedly build fake datasets inline — a tiny shared `demo-data` module would shrink several
  300–400-line pages.
- `ErrorPanel` inside `server-data-grid.tsx` overlaps with `SmartPageError` — unify on one error-state primitive.

**Wrapper opportunities**

- `fetchUsersPage` embeds fetch + Zod parse + error mapping; generalize into a `createPageFetcher(schema, url)` helper
  in the data-grid layer so every consumer gets validated fetching for free.

**Large / complex components (top offenders by LOC)**

| File                                             |   LOC | Recommendation                                                                                                                                                |

| `components/sidebar.tsx`                         |   728 | Vendored shadcn block — leave as-is                                                                                                                           |
| `form-engine/smart-form.tsx`                     |   719 | Extract `FieldRenderer`'s switch into a field-registry map (`Record<FieldType, Component>`); shrinks the file and opens the door to custom field registration |
| `data-grid/server-data-grid.tsx`                 |   609 | Extract shared `GridToolbar`; otherwise cohesive                                                                                                              |
| `smart-components/page/smart-page.tsx`           |   553 | Split per-layout render functions into modules                                                                                                                |

# UI/UX Review

- **Consistency:** Strong. One design-token vocabulary (`globals.css` `@theme inline` variables), one icon set (lucide),
  consistent density constants for grids (36/44/56 px rows).
- **Spacing & typography:** Tailwind scale discipline; Inter variable font with `--font-heading`;
  prettier-plugin-tailwindcss keeps class order canonical.
- **Responsiveness:** Toolbars collapse (`flex-col sm:flex-row`), sidebar has mobile behavior via `use-mobile`; grid
  `fill` mode solves full-viewport layouts without `100vh` hacks. Grid-heavy pages remain desktop-first — acceptable for
  the domain.
- **Accessibility:** Decent baseline: Base UI primitives bring correct semantics; 63 library files use `aria-*`; the
  form engine focuses the first errored field after failed submit and gates error display on blur/submit (excellent
  pattern). Gaps: no automated a11y checks (no `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, no axe tests), no skip-to-content link in the
  shell, and the global **`d` keyboard shortcut** toggling theme (`theme-provider.tsx:142-180`) is undiscoverable and
  could collide with user expectations or assistive tech — there is **no visible theme toggle at all** (`useTheme` has
  zero consumers).
- **Dark mode:** Fully tokenized and it works — but see above: unreachable through the UI.
- **Loading states:** First-class (`SmartLoadingOverlay`, `SmartSpinner`, `SmartPageLoading`, grid initial-load overlay,
  MSW latency of 450 ms to make them visible).
- **Error states:** First-class in the grid (error panel with Retry) and page system (`SmartPageError`); inline field
  errors in forms.
- **Empty states:** First-class (`SmartEmptyState` via `NoRowsOverlay`, `SmartPageEmpty`).

---

# Code Quality

- **Naming:** Uniform and predictable (`Smart*` public components, `*-internals` for private helpers, `use-*` hooks,
  kebab-case files). No abbreviations soup.
- **Formatting:** Prettier enforced pre-commit; consistent (no-semicolons, double quotes, 80 cols).
- **Dead code:** The 10 orphaned primitives + their 4 orphaned dependencies (recharts, @tanstack/react-table,
  embla-carousel-react, react-resizable-panels — embla/resizable are imported only by orphaned components), unused
  `@playwright/test`, unused `@turbo/gen`, `hooks/.gitkeep` alongside a real file, and the stray `console.log(res)` in
  `users.ts:35`.
- **Duplicate code:** Limited (grid toolbars, use-mobile, demo datasets) — see Component Review.
- **Long methods/components:** Only the five files listed above; everything else is small and single-purpose.
- **Magic values:** Consistently named (`LATENCY`, `MOBILE_BREAKPOINT`, `rowHeightByDensity`, `COLS/SPAN` maps). Grid
  defaults (page size 20, height 480) are documented props.
- **Comments:** The best I've seen in a repo this young — they explain constraints and _why_, not narration.
  `eslint-disable` comments always carry justification.
- **Maintainability:** High. A new engineer can navigate from `CLAUDE.md` alone. Risk concentration: the form engine's
  sync-effect dance and the grid's ref-plumbing are subtle — both mitigated by comments and (for the form) a dedicated
  regression test (`smart-form-sync.test.tsx`).

# Security Review

Context: a frontend component library + demo app with **no real backend, no auth, no secrets** — the attack surface is
inherently small today. Findings are therefore mostly forward-looking:

- **Auth/authorization:** None present, none needed yet. No patterns to migrate away from later — clean slate.
- **Validation:** Strong habit already: Zod validates _inbound API data_ (`pageSchema(...).parse`), not just forms. Keep
  this as a standard.
- **Secrets/env:** No `.env*` files exist; pattern is gitignored; nothing sensitive in the repo. ✔
- **Supply chain:** pnpm 10 `allowBuilds` explicitly allow-lists build scripts (esbuild yes, msw's postinstall no) —
  ahead of the curve. Lockfile committed. No dependency audit automation yet (add `pnpm audit` to future CI).
- **XSS:** Two real areas to watch: (1) `SmartTextEditor` HTML mode round-trips via `$generateNodesFromDOM` and emits
  raw HTML strings — any app that _renders_ stored editor HTML must sanitize (DOMPurify) at render time; the library
  should document this contract and/or offer a sanitizing helper. (2) No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in app code today. ✔
- **CSV/XLSX injection:** `lib/xlsx.ts` writes strings as inline strings (not formulas), which mitigates classic `=cmd`
  formula injection for the XLSX path; the CSV export in `SmartGrid` delegates to AG Grid's exporter — verify/enable its
  formula-escaping option when data becomes user-generated.
- **CSRF / injection:** No mutating endpoints exist; the query-string builder uses `URLSearchParams` (proper encoding).
  Non-issue today.
- **Headers/CSP:** No deployment config, so no CSP/security headers story yet — belongs in the deployment roadmap.

---

# Performance Review

- **Bundle size — the headline finding.** Production build emits **one 2.6 MB JS chunk** (~2.5 MiB minified; Vite
  warns >500 kB) plus 162 kB CSS. Causes:
  1. All 24 pages statically imported in [App.tsx](apps/web/src/App.tsx) — zero route-level splitting.
  2. `ensureGridModules()` registers `AllCommunityModule` (everything AG Grid Community ships) instead of the specific
     modules used.
  3. Lexical + all its plugins load eagerly even for pages without an editor.
  4. Nine Inter font subsets ship (~230 kB of woff2); most locales unused.
- **Tree shaking:** Works where it can (orphaned `chart.tsx`/recharts do _not_ end up in the bundle) — the problem is
  eager imports, not shaking. Rolldown also flags mis-positioned `#__PURE__` annotations in `@lexical/react` (upstream,
  cosmetic).
- **Code splitting / lazy loading:** None. `React.lazy` per route + `manualChunks` (vendor split for ag-grid/lexical)
  would cut initial JS by an estimated 60–75%.
- **Rendering:** Good — virtualized grids, block cache with abortable fetches (`AbortController` per block, tracked in a
  `Set`), debounced state persistence (300 ms), memoized identities for grid inputs.
- **Memoization:** Targeted, not superstitious. ✔
- **Expensive computations:** XLSX generation is synchronous on the main thread — fine at current export sizes; consider
  a worker beyond ~50k cells.
- **Caching:** localStorage grid-state persistence with debounce. No HTTP/data-layer caching (no TanStack Query) —
  acceptable for a demo, roadmap item for real apps.

# Testing Review

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit (pure logic) | **Good.** 52 tests / 7 files: `pagination` (13), `server-grid-internals` (11), `format` (10), `smart-form-sync` (7 — regression tests for the update-depth loop), `xlsx` (6), `use-server-grid-selection` (5), `smart-number-field` (3). Exactly the right things are tested first.                                             |
| Component/render  | **Near-zero.** 2 of 7 test files render components; none of the 41 smart wrappers, page system, pickers, or grids have render tests. `SmartServerGrid` tests existed and were **removed** (commit `a2f5127`) — signalling AG Grid + jsdom friction that needs a strategy (mock the grid boundary or test via browser mode/E2E). |
| Integration/E2E   | **None**, despite `@playwright/test` being installed at the root. The playground app is an ideal E2E target (deterministic MSW backend).                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Infra             | Vitest 4 + jsdom + Testing Library configured correctly (`vitest.setup.ts` with jest-dom). Pre-push runs the suite. Test environment startup dominates runtime (89 s environment vs 1.3 s tests) — consider `pool: 'threads'`/project config as suite grows.                                                                    |

**Biggest risks untested:** SmartForm field rendering per type, SmartPage slot/layout detection, grid toolbar behaviors,
Lexical toolbar, theme provider hotkey/storage sync.

# Documentation Review

- **README.md:** Stock template ("shadcn/ui monorepo template") with a garbled trailing artifact (
  `# a u t o m a t i c - o c t o - f i e s t a`). Does not mention the form engine, grids, page system, MSW, or scripts.
  **The single worst doc artifact in the repo.**
- **CLAUDE.md:** Excellent and accurate — commands, architecture, exports map, placement rules, internals map. Currently
  the _real_ onboarding doc, though written for an AI assistant.
- **Inline/JSDoc:** Outstanding (see Code Quality). Public props documented member-by-member with `@example` blocks on
  major components.
- **Architecture docs:** None beyond CLAUDE.md; no ADRs (several decisions deserve one: Base UI over Radix, hand-rolled
  xlsx, source-only package, Spring page contract).
- **API/usage docs:** None. No Storybook/Ladle; the playground app is the implicit documentation, but nothing maps "
  component → demo route".
- **Onboarding:** `pnpm install && pnpm dev` works, but only CLAUDE.md says so.

# Priority Improvements

**Critical**

1. Stand up CI (lint + typecheck + test + build on every PR).

**High** 2. Route-level code splitting + AG Grid module slimming (bundle ↓ 60–75%). 3. Component test strategy + restore
grid coverage + Playwright smoke suite. 4. Rewrite README / add real consumer documentation.

**Medium** 5. Dependency & dead-code purge (orphans, misplaced `vitest`, unused playwright/recharts/react-table). 6.
Visible theme toggle; tame the `d` hotkey. 7. Discriminated-union `FieldDefinition`. 8. Toolbar-plugin and
`smart-form.tsx` decomposition (field registry). 9. Coverage thresholds in CI; Changesets for versioning.

**Low** 10. `console.log` removal, `use-mobile` dedupe, `@source` glob fix, tsconfig cleanup, ADRs for the four big
decisions.

# Top 20 Improvements (sorted by impact)

1. **Add GitHub Actions CI** — lint, typecheck, test, build on PR/main. (Critical, 0.5–1 d)
2. **Route-based code splitting** with `React.lazy` + Suspense in `apps/web`. (High, 1 d)
3. **Register only needed AG Grid modules** instead of `AllCommunityModule`. (High, 0.5 d)
4. **Vendor chunking** (`manualChunks`: ag-grid, lexical, react) + bundle-size check in CI. (High, 0.5 d)
5. **Component render tests** for the top-10 most-used smart components. (High, 2–3 d)
6. **Playwright smoke E2E** against the MSW-backed playground (dep already installed). (High, 1–2 d)
7. **Rewrite README.md** — what/why/quickstart/scripts/architecture links. (High, 0.5 d)
8. **Purge dead code & deps** — 10 orphan primitives, recharts, react-table, misplaced vitest, unused
   playwright/turbo-gen. (Medium, 0.5 d)
9. **Visible theme toggle** + make the global `d` hotkey opt-in. (Medium, 0.5 d)
10. **Restore SmartServerGrid test coverage** with an explicit AG Grid mocking boundary. (Medium, 1–2 d)
11. **Discriminated-union `FieldDefinition`** for compile-time field-config safety. (Medium, 1–2 d)
12. **Field-registry refactor of `smart-form.tsx`** — kills the 250-line switch, enables custom field types. (Medium, 1
    d)
13. **Decompose `toolbar-plugin.tsx`** into per-section modules. (Medium, 1–2 d)
14. **Delete `console.log`, dedupe `use-mobile`, fix `@source` globs, tsconfig cleanup.** (Low, 1 h total)
15. **Coverage thresholds** wired into CI (`@vitest/coverage-v8` already installed). (Medium, 0.5 d)
16. **Consumer docs per domain** (form engine, data grid, page system) — usage + props + gotchas. (Medium, 1–2 d)
17. **Changesets** for versioning/changelogs ahead of any external consumption. (Medium, 1 d)
18. **`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` + axe checks** in tests/CI. (Medium, 1 d)
19. **Document/sanitize Lexical HTML contract** (DOMPurify helper or explicit consumer requirement). (Medium, 0.5–1 d)
20. **Extract shared `GridToolbar`** from the two grids; unify `ErrorPanel` with `SmartPageError`. (Low, 1 d)
